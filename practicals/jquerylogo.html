            jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
            The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
            jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
            jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
            The jQuery library contains the following features:<br/>
                * HTML/DOM manipulation<br/>
                * CSS manipulation<br/>
                * HTML event methods<br/>
                * Effects and animations<br/>
                * AJAX<br/>
                * Utilities<br/>
        </p>
