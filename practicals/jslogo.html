        JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the
         ECMAScript specification.JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, 
         and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
         object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the 
        World Wide Web.Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
        often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated 
        JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and 
        imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) 
        for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and 
        the Document Object Model (DOM).
