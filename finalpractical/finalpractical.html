                      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
                  HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the 
                  web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the 
                  structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text 
                  so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) 
                  are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
                       HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order
                  to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever
                  version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1999.

                  Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                  CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning CSS:
                    * Create Stunning Web site - CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can &npscontrol the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.
                    * Become a web designer - If you want to start a carrer as a professional web designer, HTML and CSS designing is a must skill.
                    * Control web - CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.
                    * Learn other languages - Once you understands the basic of HTML and CSS then other related technologies like javascript, php, or angular are become easier to understand.
